Plone Portlets Implementation
=============================

This package provides the fundamentals for managing portlets in Plone. Portlets are implemented here as an extension to the zope.viewlet infrastructure based on the following principles:

o Anything can be made into a portlet. For example a Smart Folder (aka Topic, a canned search) can be turned into a portlet to list its contents.

This is done by marking the instance with IPortletDataProvider, a generic marker interface, and providing an adapter to IPortletViewlet that is capable of rendering it as a portlet.

Naturally, more specific implementations can be provided too. Anything that can be adapted to IPortletViewlet is potentially a portlet, and it does not necessarily need to be rooted in a content object. The IPortletDataProvider is an abstraction of the fact that most portlets will need some kind of persistent per-instance configuration.

o Portlets can be assigned to locations (e.g. folders), groups or users.

A local utility providing IPortletStorage stores the mappings of context-to-portlet, be the context a location, a group or a user. It is then capable of composing the list of portlets to be rendered at any given time.

This actually stores instances of IPortletAssignment mapped to viewlet managers and locations, groups and users. IPortletAssignment should be more light-weight than a fully-fledged IPortletData, and thus more efficient to store. It provides an attribute 'data' that will be used to retrieve the appropriate IPortletData on demand.

o Portlets are assigned to and rendered by a special kind of viewlet manager.

The interface IPortletViewletManager describes a viewlet manager that will discover which viewlets to render by adapting the context to IPortletRetrieval.

This in turn will (by default) query the active IPortletStorage for a list of portlets to be rendered relative to the context it is adapted on, and the current user and the user's groups. This yields a list of IPortletAssignments, which in turn yields a list of IPortletData instances. Each of these will be adapted to an IPortletViewlet before being returned to the IPortletViewletManager for rendering.

o A context capable of being assigned portlets (via some UI outside this package) will be adaptable to IPortletManager. This mediates between the context (which may be a location, a user or a group) and the IPortletStorage where IPortletAssignments are stored.

Note - the majority of the interfaces found in interfaces.py refer to things which are application-specific. These are implemented for Plone in the package plone.app.portlets.
